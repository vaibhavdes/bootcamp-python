  # We already used few of python function, do you remember ? e.g print(), type()
  # Function are reusable
  
  # Try this
  var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  var2 = True
  
  # Use print() in combination with type() to print out the type of var1.
  print(type(var1))
  
  # Use len() to get the length of the list var1. Wrap it in a print() call to directly print it out.
  print(len(var1))

  # Use int() to convert var2 to an integer. Store the output as out2.
  out2 = int(var2)
