  # In Previous Lesson we learned different data types as follows
  # int = integer
  # float = floating
  # str = string
  # bool = boolean
  
  # In this we gonna learn about making Data Points (Which are inter-related to each other) this can be used in future for analysis.
  
  # List (Values are wrapped in Square Brackets [...] )
  # 1. Collection of Values
  # 2. Contain values of type (As Per Mentioned Data Types Above and advanced types)
  # 3. Contain values of Different Types (Can Contain Lists in List i.e Sub-List)
  
  # Lets take an example below list contain family member name with age
  my_family = ['x',21,'y',24]
  type(my_family)
  
  # Also it can be represented as Sub-List
  my_family = [['x',21],
               ['y',24]
              ]
  type(my_family)
